                I was abandoned on a seat on the IRT #1 train inside of a black backpack. 
                The conductor was informed of a suspicious package and the train halted.
                They cautiously lifted open the unzipped backpack and found me amid 
                a slew of restaurant kitchen towels which had the fresh imprints 
                of all of my siblings. I was then rescued by a passenger in the crowd 
                who snuck me into her office inside of an UGG sheepskin hat and eventually,
                I went home with that girl.
